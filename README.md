# Class11Homework

Describe the assignment
To create a webpage that upon user interaction retrieves data from an API and some display from a js library.

Discuss what you chose to do and why
I chose to create a website where someone can enter a random word and then a song with that word in the lyrics will appear, along with the flocking lyrics. I thought this would be really cool and funny.

Document any resources/research/inspiration
p5 library

Explain your process
I was exploring the p5 library and the best way to display lyrics on a page

Highlight both successes and failures
Success: I am getting better at learning js, and have learned how to split information from the data
Failure: My canvas is wonky, and data will not display on it...got to fix that somehow and get help
